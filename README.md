# Order reference

By default, PrestaShop generates for orders only random alpha (A-Z) references.
This module allows you to choose how to generate the order references.
You can choose between:
- random numeric reference (743623, 912012, etc)
- consequent reference based on order ID (0000046, 0000047, etc)
- or leave as is :)

You can also define the length of the generated reference (from minimum of 6
characters to max of 12).
